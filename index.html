<p>This article explores the best practices for managing employee career development in engineering management.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-employee-career-development">Understanding Employee Career Development</h2>

<p>Employee career development refers to the progression of an employee’s career goals, skills, knowledge, and experience over time. It involves identifying career paths, setting career goals, acquiring necessary skills, and achieving career milestones. Career development can involve promotions, lateral moves, skill enhancement, or even a change of career direction.</p>

<p>As an engineering manager, your role in managing career development is to guide, support, and facilitate your team members in their career journeys. It’s about helping them realize their full potential, align their career goals with the organization’s objectives, and navigate the opportunities and challenges in their career paths.</p>

<h2 id="best-practices-for-managing-employee-career-development">Best Practices for Managing Employee Career Development</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Understand Individual Career Aspirations</strong>: Every engineer on your team will have unique career aspirations, interests, and values. It’s important to understand these individual differences and consider them in career development planning. Regular one-on-one meetings are a great opportunity to discuss career aspirations, identify career goals, and understand what motivates and interests each team member.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Define Clear Career Paths</strong>: Career paths in engineering can be diverse and multifaceted, involving different specializations, roles, and levels. Define clear career paths within your organization, outlining the roles, skills, qualifications, and experiences required at each level. This provides a roadmap for your team members to plan and navigate their career progression.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Set SMART Career Goals</strong>: Career goals should be SMART - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Work with each team member to set SMART career goals that align with their career aspirations and the organization’s objectives. Regularly review and adjust these goals as needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provide Opportunities for Skill Development</strong>: Continuous skill development is crucial for career advancement in engineering. Provide opportunities for your team members to learn and develop the skills needed for their career goals. This could involve on-the-job training, workshops, courses, conferences, mentorship, or self-learning resources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Offer Career Development Support</strong>: Career development can involve challenges, uncertainties, and transitions. Provide support to your team members throughout their career journeys, helping them make informed career decisions, overcome obstacles, and manage transitions. This could involve career coaching, mentorship, or support from HR or career services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Foster a Culture of Learning and Growth</strong>: A culture that values learning and growth encourages continuous career development. Foster this culture by recognizing and rewarding learning and growth, promoting knowledge sharing, and providing a safe environment for experimentation and learning from failure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Facilitate Internal Mobility</strong>: Internal mobility, such as lateral moves or promotions within the organization, can provide valuable career development opportunities. Facilitate internal mobility by keeping your team informed about internal opportunities, encouraging them to apply, and supporting them in the transition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provide Performance Feedback and Career Guidance</strong>: Regular performance feedback and career guidance are critical for career development. Provide constructive feedback on your team’s work, highlighting strengths, areas for improvement, and strategies for development. Discuss their career progress, provide guidance on career opportunities and challenges, and help them align their performance with their career goals.</p>
  </li>

Express your concern, ask about their wellbeing, and listen empathetically. Avoid making assumptions or judgments, and reassure them of your support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Implement and Enforce Boundaries</strong>: Revisit work schedules, responsibilities, and expectations to ensure they are realistic and sustainable. Implement and enforce boundaries to prevent overwork, such as setting clear start and end times for work, discouraging after-hours emails, and protecting lunch breaks and vacation times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provide Support and Resources</strong>: Offer support and resources to help the employee manage stress and recover from burnout. This could include providing access to mental health resources, offering flexible work arrangements, or connecting them with a mentor or coach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Review and Adjust Workloads</strong>: If burnout is a result of an excessive workload, review and adjust the tasks and responsibilities of the affected team member. Consider redistributing tasks, extending deadlines, or bringing in additional help if necessary.</p>

    <p>Define Tasks Clearly: Each delegated task should be defined clearly. This includes the task’s objectives, expected outcomes, deadlines, and any necessary resources or tools. Avoid vague instructions or assumptions. Ensure the person understands the task and its importance in the broader project context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Match Tasks to Skills: Assign tasks based on team members’ skills and development goals. This not only increases the chances of the task being done well, but also motivates individuals by showing trust in their abilities and providing opportunities for growth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Delegate Authority Along with Responsibility: Delegation is not just about assigning tasks; it’s also about entrusting authority. When you delegate a task, ensure the person has the authority to make decisions related to it. This empowers your team members, fosters their problem-solving skills, and reduces bottlenecks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set Clear Expectations: Ensure your team members know what is expected of them. This includes the quality of work, deadlines, and the degree of autonomy they have. Setting clear expectations upfront can prevent misunderstandings and ensure accountability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Monitor Progress, Don’t Micromanage: While it’s important to monitor progress and provide support, avoid micromanaging. Give your team members the freedom to complete tasks in their own way. Regular check-ins or status updates can help keep you informed without being intrusive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide Feedback and Recognize Efforts: Provide constructive feedback to help your team members improve. Recognize their efforts and celebrate successes. This not only boosts morale, but also promotes a culture of continuous learning and improvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Foster a Safe Environment for Mistakes: Mistakes are an inevitable part of learning. Foster an environment where mistakes are seen as learning opportunities, not failures. Encourage your team to take risks, experiment, and learn from their mistakes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="delegation-scenarios-and-strategies-in-engineering-management">Delegation Scenarios and Strategies in Engineering Management</h2>

<p>Let’s consider a few scenarios where delegation is particularly crucial in engineering management, along with strategies to handle them effectively.</p>

    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Conflict is an inevitable part of any organization, and engineering teams are no exception. As an engineering manager, dealing with conflict is one of the most challenging aspects of the role. However, if handled effectively, conflict can lead to innovation, improved team dynamics, and increased productivity. This article will explore best practices for managing conflict in engineering management.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-nature-of-conflict">Understanding the Nature of Conflict</h2>

<p>Before we delve into conflict management strategies, it’s crucial to understand what conflict is and why it occurs. In the simplest terms, conflict arises from differences. These differences can be in perspectives, interests, or values.</p>

<p>In the context of an engineering team, conflicts can stem from disagreements over technical decisions, project priorities, or resource allocation. They can also arise from personal differences or communication breakdowns.</p>

<p>Regardless of the cause, conflicts can have significant negative impacts if not addressed. These can include decreased productivity, damaged relationships, increased stress, and a hostile work environment.</p>

<h2 id="adopting-a-proactive-approach">Adopting a Proactive Approach</h2>

<p>The first best practice in managing conflict is to adopt a proactive approach. This involves creating an environment where conflicts are less likely to occur and, when they do, they are handled constructively.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Promote Open Communication: Encourage team members to share their ideas, concerns, and feedback openly. Regular team meetings, one-on-ones, and open-door policies can facilitate this.</li>
  <li>Set Clear Expectations: Make sure your team understands their roles, responsibilities, and the standards expected of them.</li>
  <li>Encourage Collaboration: Foster a collaborative culture where team members work together and support each other.</li>
  <li>Provide Training: Provide your team with training in communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution skills.</li>
  <li>Despite your best efforts, conflicts will inevitably arise. Here are some best practices for managing conflicts when they occur.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="listen-actively">Listen Actively</h2>

<p>When a conflict arises, the first step is to listen actively to all parties involved. This involves not just hearing the words, but understanding the underlying feelings, needs, and concerns.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Empathize: Try to understand the situation from each person’s perspective.</li>
  <li>Ask Questions: Ask open-ended questions to get a deeper understanding of the issue.</li>
  <li>Paraphrase: Paraphrase what you’ve heard to confirm your understanding.</li>
  <li>Mediate Fairly</li>
</ul>

<p>As a manager, your role is to mediate the conflict in a fair and neutral manner. Avoid taking sides or making judgments prematurely.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Facilitate Dialogue: Encourage the conflicting parties to communicate directly with each other, expressing their viewpoints respectfully.</li>
  <li>Focus on Interests, Not Positions: Encourage team members to express their underlying needs and concerns, rather than sticking to their initial positions.</li>
  <li>Generate Options: Help the parties involved generate multiple options for resolving the conflict.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="resolve-and-learn">Resolve and Learn</h2>

<p>Once a resolution has been reached, it’s crucial to ensure that it’s implemented and the conflict doesn’t recur.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Follow Up: Monitor the situation to ensure that the agreed-upon resolution is implemented.</li>
  <li>Reflect and Learn: Reflect on the conflict and its resolution. What can be learned? How can similar conflicts be prevented in the future?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dont-avoid-difficult-conversations">Don’t Avoid Difficult Conversations</h2>

<p>One of the biggest mistakes managers make is avoiding difficult conversations. However, ignoring conflicts doesn’t make them disappear; it often makes them worse. Address conflicts promptly and directly, while treating all parties with respect and fairness.</p>

<h2 id="leverage-diversity">Leverage Diversity</h2>

<p>Diverse teams bring different perspectives and ideas, which can lead to conflicts. However, this diversity can also be a strength. Encourage your team to see differences as opportunities for learning and innovation, rather than sources of conflict.</p>

<h2 id="seek-help-when-needed">Seek Help When Needed</h2>

<p>If a conflict is particularly challenging or if it’s causing significant disruption, don’t hesitate to seek help. This could be from a higher-level manager, a human resources professional, or an external mediator or coach.</p>

<h2 id="know-when-to-escalate">Know When to Escalate</h2>

<p>While most conflicts can be managed at the team level, there are situations when escalation is necessary. This could be when the conflict involves serious misconduct, such as harassment or discrimination, or when it’s causing significant harm to individuals or the team.</p>

<h2 id="foster-a-culture-of-respect">Foster a Culture of Respect</h2>

<p>At the heart of effective conflict management is a culture of respect. This involves treating each other with kindness and understanding, even when disagreements occur. It also involves respecting diversity and different viewpoints.</p>

<h2 id="the-role-of-emotional-intelligence">The Role of Emotional Intelligence</h2>

<p>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) plays a crucial role in conflict management. This includes self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, and social skills.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Self-Awareness: Recognize your own emotions and how they can impact your reactions to conflict.</li>
  <li>Self-Regulation: Manage your emotions effectively to remain calm and composed during conflicts.</li>
  <li>Empathy: Understand and share the feelings of others, which can help de-escalate conflicts.</li>
  <li>Social Skills: Use effective communication and interpersonal skills to manage and resolve conflicts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="balancing-assertiveness-and-cooperation">Balancing Assertiveness and Cooperation</h2>

<p>Managing conflict effectively requires a balance of assertiveness and cooperation. This involves standing up for your own or your team’s needs and interests, while also seeking to understand and accommodate the needs of others.</p>

<h2 id="promote-psychological-safety">Promote Psychological Safety</h2>

<p>Psychological safety is a sense of trust and respect among team members, where individuals feel safe to express their ideas, take risks, and make mistakes without fear of punishment or ridicule. Teams with high psychological safety are more likely to handle conflicts constructively, as team members feel safe to express their disagreements openly and respectfully.</p>

<h2 id="common-conflict-scenarios-and-strategies-for-resolution">Common Conflict Scenarios and Strategies for Resolution</h2>

<p>Let’s examine a few common conflict scenarios within engineering teams, and strategies for resolving them effectively.</p>

<h3 id="scenario-1-disagreement-over-technical-decisions">Scenario 1: Disagreement Over Technical Decisions</h3>

<p>Imagine a situation where two senior engineers, Alice and Bob, have a disagreement over the choice of technology for a new project. Alice believes that adopting a new, cutting-edge technology is the best approach, as it offers advanced features and future-proofs the project. Bob, on the other hand, argues for using a tried-and-true technology that the team is familiar with, to minimize risk and deliver on time.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution Strategy</strong></p>

<p>In this situation, as a manager, your role is to facilitate a constructive dialogue between Alice and Bob. Encourage them to express their viewpoints, focusing on the underlying interests and concerns, rather than sticking to their initial positions.</p>

<p>For example, Alice’s interest might be in innovation and staying competitive, while Bob’s interest might be in risk management and efficient delivery. Recognizing these underlying interests can open up new options. Perhaps there’s a way to incorporate the new technology in a limited, controlled way that allows for innovation while managing risk. Or maybe the team could invest in training and support to mitigate the risks associated with the new technology.</p>

<h3 id="scenario-2-personality-clashes">Scenario 2: Personality Clashes</h3>

<p>Consider another scenario where two team members, Carlos and David, have a personality clash. Carlos is extroverted, outspoken, and likes to brainstorm ideas in group settings. David is introverted, prefers quiet to concentrate, and likes to think through his ideas before sharing them. Their differing styles have led to tension and misunderstandings.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution Strategy</strong></p>

<p>In this scenario, it’s important to facilitate a conversation between Carlos and David, helping them understand each other’s work styles and needs. Encourage empathy and mutual respect.</p>

<p>For instance, Carlos could be encouraged to give David a heads-up before discussions and respect his need for quiet working time. David, on the other hand, could be encouraged to express his ideas even if they’re not fully formed, to contribute to the team’s brainstorming sessions.</p>

<p>By understanding and accommodating each other’s styles, Carlos and David can turn their differences into strengths, fostering a more diverse and inclusive team culture.</p>

<h3 id="scenario-3-conflict-over-priorities">Scenario 3: Conflict Over Priorities</h3>

<p>In another situation, Emma, a software engineer, feels frustrated because she’s constantly being pulled into urgent bug fixes, leaving her with no time to work on her main project. Frank, the support engineer, feels that resolving customer issues should always be the top priority.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution Strategy</strong></p>

<p>In this case, it’s crucial to clarify roles, responsibilities, and priorities. You may need to step in and make a decision, or facilitate a discussion with Emma and Frank about how to balance immediate customer needs with long-term project goals.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is a way to streamline the bug-fixing process, or allocate specific times for it, so it doesn’t interrupt Emma’s project work. Alternatively, there might be a need for additional resources or better coordination between the project and support teams.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Managing conflict in engineering management is a complex task that requires a diverse set of skills, from effective communication and active listening to empathy, patience, and fairness. It’s about creating a culture where conflicts are not feared or avoided, but embraced as opportunities for learning, growth, and innovation.</p>

<p>Remember that conflict is not inherently bad. When handled effectively, it can lead to better decisions, increased creativity, stronger relationships, and a more engaged and productive team. As an engineering manager, your role is not to eliminate conflict, but to manage it constructively, turning challenges into opportunities for team growth and success.</p>

        <h2 itemprop="name headline"><a href="https://pyartez.github.io/management/transitioning-from-engineer-to-engineering-manager.html">Transitioning from Engineer to Engineering Manager: The Uncharted Terrain</a></h2>
    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>In the world of tech, transitioning from the role of an engineer to an engineering manager is often viewed as a natural progression. Many engineers, after having honed their technical skills, look forward to the opportunity of expanding their sphere of influence by stepping into a managerial role. However, this transition is not as straightforward as it may seem at first glance. It presents a new set of challenges that are fundamentally different from those encountered in a purely technical role.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-role-shift-from-problem-solver-to-enabler">Understanding the Role Shift: From Problem-Solver to Enabler</h2>

<p>One of the most significant challenges in transitioning from engineer to engineering manager is accepting and understanding the fundamental shift in roles. As an engineer, your primary role is to solve technical problems - whether it’s writing code, debugging issues, or designing software architecture. Your success is often measured by the quality of the solutions you deliver and the technical challenges you overcome.</p>

<p>However, as an engineering manager, your role involves less hands-on problem-solving and more enabling your team to solve problems. You become a facilitator, mentor, and guide, helping to clear roadblocks and provide resources for your team. Your success is now measured less by your personal technical accomplishments and more by the achievements of your team.</p>

<p>This shift from individual contributor to team leader can be challenging and even discomforting for many new managers. It requires a change in mindset, where you need to redefine what productivity and success mean to you. You’ll need to find fulfillment in the success of others, which can be a difficult transition for someone used to personal technical achievements.</p>

<h2 id="mastering-the-art-of-time-management-and-prioritization">Mastering the Art of Time Management and Prioritization</h2>

<p>As an engineer, you are often given well-defined tasks and deadlines. Your work is scoped, and you can focus your efforts on technical problem-solving. However, as a manager, your responsibilities become varied and often less defined. You’ll be juggling multiple tasks, from strategic planning and goal-setting to recruitment, team-building, and administrative duties.</p>

<p>Consequently, effective time management and prioritization become essential skills. You’ll need to learn to balance urgent issues with important long-term goals, delegate tasks, and sometimes, even say ‘no’ to avoid overcommitting yourself or your team.</p>

<h2 id="navigating-the-human-element-people-management">Navigating the Human Element: People Management</h2>

<p>Perhaps one of the biggest challenges for many new engineering managers is people management. While your previous role primarily involved interacting with code, your new role will involve interacting with people. Understanding and managing human dynamics is much more complex and unpredictable than solving technical problems.</p>

<p>You’ll need to cultivate a diverse set of skills, including effective communication, conflict resolution, and motivational abilities. You’ll have to navigate team dynamics, manage conflicting personalities, understand individual motivations, and foster a positive, productive work environment. You’ll also need to provide feedback, mentorship, and career development for your team members - tasks that require empathy, patience, and understanding.</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge-of-delayed-feedback">The Challenge of Delayed Feedback</h2>

<p>In engineering, feedback is often immediate and clear-cut. You write code, run it, and see the results. If something breaks, you fix it. Your impact is visible and quantifiable. However, as a manager, feedback is often delayed and less tangible.</p>

<p>The impact of decisions you make or initiatives you implement may not be evident for weeks or even months. Measuring success becomes trickier, as it’s often tied to team performance, employee satisfaction, and long-term project outcomes. This delay in feedback can be disconcerting and requires patience, long-term thinking, and an ability to see the big picture.</p>

<h2 id="growing-into-a-visionary-leader">Growing into a Visionary Leader</h2>

<p>As an engineer, you are typically tasked with implementing visions and plans created by others. However, as an engineering manager, you are expected to set the vision and chart the course. This involves strategic thinking, decision-making under uncertainty, and the ability to inspire and motivate your team to align with your vision. It requires you to shift from a detail-oriented focus to a broader perspective, which can be challenging for many who are used to the concrete world of coding.</p>

<h2 id="the-isolated-landscape-of-management">The Isolated Landscape of Management</h2>

<p>Being a manager can sometimes feel isolating. You’re often privy to sensitive information that you can’t share with your team. There may be company decisions you have to uphold even if you don’t personally agree with them. You may need to mediate conflicts, deliver difficult feedback, or make tough decisions that not everyone will like. This can create a sense of being ‘alone in the middle’ - between your team and upper management - which many new managers are unprepared for.</p>

<h2 id="the-conquest-of-the-challenges-strategies-for-success">The Conquest of the Challenges: Strategies for Success</h2>

<p>While these challenges might seem daunting, they can be successfully managed with the right strategies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Embrace the Change: Recognize that your role has fundamentally changed. Embrace your new identity as a facilitator and leader, and take pride in the success of your team.</li>
  <li>Develop New Skills: Invest time in developing essential managerial skills, such as effective communication, conflict resolution, strategic thinking, and time management. These are just as important as your technical skills in your new role.</li>
  <li>Seek Mentorship: Find mentors who can guide you through this transition. They can provide invaluable advice, insights, and moral support.</li>
  <li>Prioritize Self-Care: The role of a manager can be stressful. Make sure to take care of your mental health. Practice mindfulness, maintain a healthy work-life balance, and seek professional help if needed.</li>
  <li>Embrace Continuous Learning: Accept that you’ll make mistakes, but view them as learning opportunities. Strive to learn and grow continuously.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Transitioning from engineer to engineering manager is a significant career shift, filled with challenges but also opportunities for personal and professional growth. It’s a journey that requires not just technical expertise but also a broad range of soft skills.</p>

<p>However, it’s important to remember that management is not the only path for career progression. Many companies now offer ‘individual contributor’ tracks, allowing engineers to take on more complex problems and responsibilities without moving into management.</p>

<p>Whether you decide to pursue management or remain an individual contributor, the key is to understand your strengths, passions, and career aspirations, and align them with your chosen path. Remember, a successful career is not just about titles or roles, but about continuous learning, growth, and making a positive impact in your organization.</p>

<p>In the end, whether you’re writing code or leading a team, the most important thing is to find joy and fulfillment in what you do. This will not only lead to personal satisfaction but also to a successful and rewarding career.</p>

        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In this series of posts we are going to be covering the SOLID principles of software development. These are a set of principles / guidelines, that when followed when developing a software system, make it more likely that the system will be easier to extend and maintain over time. Let’s take a look at the problems that they seek to solve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fragility: A change may break unexpected parts, it is very difficult to detect if you don’t have a good test coverage</li>
  <li>Immobility: A component is difficult to reuse in another project or in multiple places of the same project because it has too many coupled dependencies</li>
  <li>Rigidity: A change requires a lot of effort because it affects several parts of the project</li>
</ul>

<p>So what are the SOLID principles?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Single Responsibility Principle - A class should have only a single responsibility / have only one reason to change</li>
  <li>Open-Closed Principle - Software should be open for extension but closed for modification</li>
  <li>Liskov Substitution Principle - Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their sub types without altering the correctness of the program</li>
  <li>Interface Segregation Principle - Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface</li>
  <li>Dependency Inversion Principle - High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions</li>
</ul>

<p>In this article we will focus on the Dependency Inversion Principle.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-mean">What does it mean?</h2>

<p>This principle has 2 main components described below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces)
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve interviewed many iOS developers over the years and I struggle to recall a single person who has actually got this part of the SOLID principles 100% right. I think a large part of this comes from the fact many use simple architectures such as MVVM that don’t break applications down into smaller layers and components/modules. This isn’t a criticism, not every app needs a VIPER/Clean architecture approach with multiple layers.</p>

<p>Most iOS developers I speak to come to the conclusion that this principle just means using protocols instead of concrete classes and injecting dependencies to help with testing/mocking. While this principle does rely on this to work it is not the primary purpose of the principle and exposes an issue once you start to depend on abstractions used across multiple layers / modules.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>Lets setup a simple example in Xcode where we have two separate modules that depend on each other in order to provide some functionality.</p>

<p>If we create a simple Swift UI project using Xcode, then using File -&gt; New -&gt; Package create 2 new swift packages and add them to the project. One called LibraryA and one called LibraryB. Be sure to select your project in the ‘Add to’ drop down when naming your libraries. You should have something that looks like below Xcode.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/packages-setup.png" alt="Swift Packages Setup" title="Swift Packages Setup" /></p>

<p>Let’s start by adding a protocol and some custom data structure that we are going to be using across the 2 libraries we are working. Add a file called Protocol.swift in LibraryA and add the following code below:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="kd">import</span> <span class="kt">Foundation</span>

<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">protocol</span> <span class="kt">MyProtocol</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">doSomething</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">data</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">MyData</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">struct</span> <span class="kt">MyData</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">title</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">String</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">subTitle</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">String</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We have a simple one function protocol and a small struct, this is what we will be using to separate dependencies between our 2 libraries.</p>

<p>Next, lets create an implementation in LibraryA that has these protocols as a dependency. Create a file in LibraryA with the name ImplementationA:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="kd">import</span> <span class="kt">Foundation</span>

<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">ImplementationA</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">something</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">MyProtocol</span>
    
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="nf">init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">something</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">MyProtocol</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">something</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">something</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is just a simple class that has the MyProtocol protocol has a dependency. Simple enough so far!</p>

<p>Now let’s create a class in LibraryB that implements the protocol that is being used in our class in LibraryA. Create a class in LibraryB called ImplementationB:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="kd">import</span> <span class="kt">Foundation</span>
<span class="kd">import</span> <span class="kt">LibraryA</span>

<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">ImplementationB</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">MyProtocol</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="nf">init</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
    
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">doSomething</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">data</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">LibraryA</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="kt">MyData</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Do something"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We have our class in LibraryB that is implementing the protocol we previously created in LibraryA. For this reason you will notice that we have to import LibraryA in this class as well. There is one additional step we need to do before this will compile correctly, we need to define our dependency in our package file. Let’s open the LibraryB package file and edit it to add the dependency between the 2 packages:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="kd">import</span> <span class="kt">PackageDescription</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">package</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">Package</span><span class="p">(</span>

    <span class="p">],</span>
    <span class="c1">// Assign LibraryA as dependency</span>

    <span class="p">],</span>

        <span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">target</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="nv">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"LibraryB"</span><span class="p">,</span>

    <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We won’t go into all the options you need in the swift package file but hopefully by reading this you can see we have defined a dependency and added it to our LibraryB target. If you attempt to build the project it should compile successfully.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at the structure of these 2 libraries and their relationship to each other.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/libraryb-to-a.png" alt="LibraryB to LibraryA Dependency" title="LibraryB to LibraryA Dependency" /></p>

<p>As you can see, we have LibraryA, this contains the protocols and LibraryB that implements the protocols. In order for LibraryB to implement the protocols it needs a dependency to LibraryA in order to work.</p>

<h2 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h2>

<p>Now what happens if we want to use the protocols in another Library? Let’s call this LibraryC? At moment the protocols are contained in LibraryA where they are being used and implemented by Library B.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can’t use the protocols in another library without adding LibraryA which may contain code and other assets we don’t want.</li>
  <li>We could copy the protocols to LibraryC, however if you needed LibraryA and LibraryC in the same project you would get class clashes.</li>
  <li>We would need to edit LibraryB to add another dependency in this case. What happens if we are not the owners of LibraryB? How would we even do this?</li>
</ul>

<p>One solution we can try is moving the protocols from LibraryA to LibraryB. This reverses the dependencies and helps to solve the problems highlighted above. Let’s go ahead and do this now.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copy the Protocols.swift file we created from LibraryA to LibraryB</li>
  <li>Remove the import of LibraryA from the implementationB.swift</li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="kd">import</span> <span class="kt">Foundation</span>

<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">ImplementationB</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">MyProtocol</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Add an import of LibraryB to the top of implementationA.swift</li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="kd">import</span> <span class="kt">Foundation</span>

<p>Now let’s see a diagram of what we have done. Now if we look at our 2 libraries at a high level the dependencies look like this.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/librarya-to-b.png" alt="LibraryA to LibraryB Dependency" title="LibraryA to LibraryB Dependency" /></p>

<p>So now, our LibraryA has a dependency on LibraryB. LibraryA is using the protocols that are defined AND implemented in LibraryB! Problem solved… right… Not entirely.</p>

<p>If we review the problems we discussed earlier, if LibraryC wanted to make use of the protocols and implementation in LibraryB that is now possible as LibraryB has no knowledge of LibraryA or LibraryC. However this creates a new problem…</p>

<h2 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h2>

<p>What if LibraryA and LibraryC want to use different implementations of the protocols from each other? What if we introduced LibraryD that wanted to implement the protocols and be used by another library such as LibraryC? In order to facilitate this we would need to create a dependency between LibraryD and LibraryB. What problems does this create?</p>

<p>We are introducing a dependency to a library we don’t need, in order to implement the protocols within it. In our example there isn’t much in LibraryB but imagine LibraryB had lots of other code and its own dependencies? Now we are including all of those in our project in order to have access to the protocols.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>This is where Dependency Inversion comes in. What we need to do is create a separate library for the protocols and any data that passes through them. Then, we make the dependencies between our different libraries to that one, thus removing the dependencies between our different layers. Let’s do that now.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a new package and add it to your project, naming it Protocols. Now move the Protocols.swift file that we created earlier into the Protocols package. Your Xcode project file explorer should look like below:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/packages-protocol-setup.png" alt="Protocols in own package" title="Protocols in own package" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Now lets edit the dependencies of our packages so that both LibraryA and LibraryB depend on protocols. Your package files for LibraryA and B should now look like the below:</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s have a look at what we have done here. We have moved the dependencies between the layers into a separate package and are now pointing both sides at that rather than one way or the other. Let’s update our diagram to show how this helps us.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dependency-inversion.png" alt="Dependency Inversion" title="Dependency Inversion" /></p>

<p>Now if we want to use LibraryA, B, C, or D it does not matter in our dependency graph. They all point to the protocols and data and can be used interchangeably without the need to modify the libraries, so they depend on each other. We also avoid importing any unnecessary classes that we don’t need in order to satisfy the dependencies.</p>

<p>This is what dependency inversion is. It’s separating protocols and data dependencies from the dependencies themselves and putting them into their own package. This way you completely separate the layers from each other, and they can be used together without any knowledge of each other. Awesome!</p>

        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In this series of posts we are going to be covering the SOLID principles of software development. These are a set of principles / guidelines, that when followed when developing a software system, make it more likely that the system will be easier to extend and maintain over time. Let’s take a look at the problems that they seek to solve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fragility: A change may break unexpected parts, it is very difficult to detect if you don’t have a good test coverage</li>
  <li>Immobility: A component is difficult to reuse in another project or in multiple places of the same project because it has too many coupled dependencies</li>
  <li>Rigidity: A change requires a lot of effort because it affects several parts of the project</li>
</ul>

<p>So what are the SOLID principles?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Single Responsibility Principle - A class should have only a single responsibility / have only one reason to change</li>
  <li>Open-Closed Principle - Software should be open for extension but closed for modification</li>
  <li>Liskov Substitution Principle - Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their sub types without altering the correctness of the program</li>
  <li>Interface Segregation Principle - Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface</li>
  <li>Dependency Inversion Principle - High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions</li>
</ul>

<p>In this article we will focus on the Interface Segregation Principle.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-mean">What does it mean?</h2>

<p>The summary of the principle is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Swift, we use <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Protocols.html">Protocols</a> rather than interfaces in languages such as Java so from here on out we will refer to interfaces as Protocols.</p>

<p>Now the purpose of this rule is quite straight forward in comparison to some of the other rules in the SOLID principles. What it means is its better to create smaller Protocols than to create one large one with lots of methods defined.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-problem">What’s the problem</h2>

<p>So why does having one large protocol cause a problem? Let’s examine one of the classic Cocoa Touch protocols to see why this is an issue.</p>

<p>I am sure many of you have implemented this protocol at some point in your past ;) I have modified the source slightly to make it easier to read and get the point across So why are we looking at this?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Only 2 methods you have to implement on the first 2.</li>
  <li>The rest of the methods are optional and you can implement whichever ones you feel you want to use.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now this protocol has its roots in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html">Objective C</a> helps it masks the problem somewhat. In Objective C as you can see in the code above its possible to mark certain functions as optional. This means you can implement them if you want to but don’t have to, this allows this protocol declaration to contain too many methods without causing problems for the implementing class.</p>

<p>In Swift, it is not possible to mark functions as optional, all functions need to be implemented. Let’s update the above protocol to be more Swifty and see what problems that might cause us.</p>

<p>Now that we have converted our protocol to be more swifty, what problem will this cause when we attempt to make a class conform to this protocol? Let’s have a look at an example.</p>

<p>Our class above now has to implement every single protocol method. Even if we don’t intend to use it. In the objective c implementation of the protocol we have the option of implementing only the ones we need whereas now we must implement every single method. Imagine all the view controllers in the world that would be full of empty methods in order to conform to this protocol!</p>

<p>This protocol breaks the interface segregation principle.</p>

</script></p>

<h2 id="a-better-solution">A better solution</h2>

<p>To improve the solution we could break the one big interface down into smaller protocols. That way we could conform to only the protocols we were interested in implementing for our functionality. This may looks something like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>UITableViewDataSource - For the 2 compulsory methods we are familier with</li>
  <li>UITableViewSectionsDatasource - For methods relating to multi section methods</li>
  <li>UITableViewSectionTitles - For methods relating to headers and footers in sections</li>
  <li>UITableViewEditable - For methods relating to editing and moving cells</li>
</ol>

<p>This way we could conform to select methods we want, rather than one big interface where we may only want a small subset of the methods.</p>

<h2 id="a-good-example">A good example</h2>

<p>A good example of interface segregation in the iOS SDK is Codable. The definition of Codable is as below:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="kd">typealias</span> <span class="kt">Codable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">Decodable</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="kt">Encodable</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Basically Codable is just the combination of 2 other protocols: Decodable and Encodable. This is a great example of how to do the interface segregation. If you are building say a JSON parse struct, you may wish to only conform to Decodable so you can decode the JSON. If in the future you wanted to serialize the struct for something like say data storage you can conform to Encoding later if needed.</p>

</script></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The interface segregation principle is the easiest of the principles to understand in my opinion. In basic terms it means don’t create a big protocol with lots of methods that aren’t always required to be implemented depending on the implementation requirements.</p>

<p>Instead, separate the protocol into smaller protocols with only the methods required for a single piece of functionality to work. Not only does this avoids having lots of redundant methods it also helps to facilitate the single responsibility principle by allowing functionality to be broken down into different classes. For example, you could have different classes to handle different activities rather than one big class with all functionality in.</p>

        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In this series of posts we are going to be covering the SOLID principles of software development. These are a set of principles / guidelines, that when followed when developing a software system, make it more likely that the system will be easier to extend and maintain over time. Let’s take a look at the problems that they seek to solve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fragility: A change may break unexpected parts, it is very difficult to detect if you don’t have a good test coverage</li>
  <li>Immobility: A component is difficult to reuse in another project or in multiple places of the same project because it has too many coupled dependencies</li>
  <li>Rigidity: A change requires a lot of effort because it affects several parts of the project</li>
</ul>

<p>So what are the SOLID principles?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Single Responsibility Principle - A class should have only a single responsibility / have only one reason to change</li>
  <li>Open-Closed Principle - Software should be open for extension but closed for modification</li>
  <li>Liskov Substitution Principle - Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their sub types without altering the correctness of the program</li>
  <li>Interface Segregation Principle - Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface</li>
  <li>Dependency Inversion Principle - High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions</li>
</ul>

<p>In this article we will focus on the Liskov Substitution Principle.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-mean">What does it mean?</h2>

<p>So the Liskov Substitution Principle states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly does this mean? In a basic sense it for example if you have a function that accepts a type of class which is a parent of other classes, any class that subclasses the parent class should be able to be passed in without it breaking the program.</p>

<p>See a summary of the main points of the principle below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Contra variance of method parameter types in the sub type.</li>
  <li>Covariance of method return types in the sub type.</li>
  <li>New exceptions cannot be thrown by the methods in the sub type, except if they are sub types of exceptions thrown by the methods of the super type.</li>
  <li>Don’t implement stricter validation rules on input parameters than those implemented by the parent class.</li>
  <li>Apply at the least the same rules to all output parameters as applied by the parent class.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a look at what these different rules mean for subclasses.</p>

<h2 id="the-parent-class">The Parent Class</h2>

<p>First of all, let’s define our parent class or base class that contains some functionality. Let’s use a vehicle class as an example, this vehicle has a throttle which can be set at any value between 0 and 100.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="c1">// 1</span>
<span class="kd">enum</span> <span class="kt">VehicleError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Error</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">outOfBounds</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="c1">// 3</span>
    <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">setThrottle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">throttle</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">throws</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nf">guard</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">contains</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">throttle</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="kt">VehicleError</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">outOfBounds</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
        <span class="k">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">throttle</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">throttle</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s step through it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First of all we define a custom error to throw if the throttle is not within bounds</li>
  <li>Here we define our vehicle class that has a throttle variable to store the value being set</li>
  <li>We have a function to set the throttle value, there is a guard statement to check whether the value being set is in the appropriate range. If it is not, we throw an error, if it is we set the value</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="validation-rules-on-input-parameters">Validation rules on input parameters</h2>

<p>Now let’s create a subclass that breaks the principle. We will make a lorry class that inherits from the super class but adds its own restrictions to the throttle function, only allowing the throttle to be set between 0 and 60 for example.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">Lorry</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Vehicle</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">override</span> <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">setThrottle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">throttle</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">throws</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nf">guard</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="mi">60</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">contains</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">throttle</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="kt">VehicleError</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">outOfBounds</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
        
        <span class="k">try</span> <span class="k">super</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">setThrottle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">throttle</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">throttle</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So what is happening here? We have subclassed the Vehicle class and overriden the setThrottle method. Now what we have done here is we have added a guard statement to check if the throttle is between 0 and 60. We throw an error saying out of bounds if outside of that, if it is within bounds we call the super class method.</p>

<p>Why is this a problem? Well imagine we are building a system / class that interacts with the Vehicle class. Now based on the Vehicle class you would expect to be able to set the throttle to anything between 0 and a 100. However now, if someone chooses to pass a Lorry subclass to your system / class, you will not be able to set the throttle above 60. Depending on how this other class or system is built this may have unintended side effects as you can’t set the values that you are expecting without getting an error.</p>

<p>This example breaks the rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t implement stricter validation rules on input parameters than those implemented by the parent class.</p>

<p>Let’s modify our example to see how we could break the principle by throwing different errors. Let’s modify the Lorry subclass:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="kd">enum</span> <span class="kt">LorryError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Error</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">outOfBounds</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">Lorry</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Vehicle</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">override</span> <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">setThrottle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">throttle</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">throws</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nf">guard</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="mi">60</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">contains</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">throttle</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="kt">LorryError</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">outOfBounds</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
        
        <span class="k">try</span> <span class="k">super</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">setThrottle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">throttle</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">throttle</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So what is happening here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We have added a new Error type called LorryError</li>
  <li>When we have our bounds exception we are throwing this new error type instead of the one provided by the super class</li>
</ul>

<p>Why does that cause a problem? To find out let’s take a look at the error handling code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="c1">// 1</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">vehicle</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Vehicle</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">Vehicle</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="k">do</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="c1">// 2</span>
    <span class="k">try</span> <span class="n">vehicle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">setThrottle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">throttle</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">110</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">catch</span> <span class="kt">VehicleError</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">outOfBounds</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="c1">// 3</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"System shutdown"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">catch</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="c1">// 4</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Show generic error"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s step through this code:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We are creating a Vehicle super class object.</li>
  <li>We are calling our function with a value considered out of bounds</li>
  <li>We catch the outOfBounds exception and print a system shutdown message</li>
  <li>We have a generic catch for other errors where we show a generic error message</li>
</ol>

<p>Now if we run this code we see the below message in the console as expected:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>System shutdown</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what happens if we replace our Lorry subclass with its new error and put it in place of the Vehicle super class? If we change line one to read:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">vehicle</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Vehicle</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">Lorry</span><span class="p">()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we run the code above we will now see a different error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Show generic error</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The error handling code is not aware of subclass specific errors so is no longer able to handle them accordingly. Imagine a mission critical system that needs to shut down if an out of bounds happens, in this case the error would be missed as it would require the error handling class to have knowledge of all possible sub types in order to handle all the errors appropriate. Defeating the point of using the super class and thus breaking the principle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>New exceptions cannot be thrown by the methods in the sub type, except if they are sub types of exceptions thrown by the methods of the super type.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="contra-variance-and-covariance-of-parameters-and-return-types">Contra variance and Covariance of parameters and return types</h2>

<p>In the list of rules you may recall seeing two items talking about contra variance and covariance of parameters and return types. What does that mean exactly?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Contra variance of method parameter types in the sub type.</li>
  <li>Covariance of method return types in the sub type.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="contra-variance-of-method-parameter-types-in-the-sub-type">Contra variance of method parameter types in the sub type</h3>

<p>Contra variance means that we can use change the type of method parameter to a super class of the type but not a subclass. This rules works basically in combination with the rule below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t implement stricter validation rules on input parameters than those implemented by the parent class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What it means is, we can use a super class of a parameter, thus ‘weakening’ the restrictions of the method, but not a subclass of that type which would tighten the restrictions of the method.</p>

<h3 id="covariance-of-method-return-types-in-the-sub-type">Covariance of method return types in the sub type</h3>

<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-6959344114005358" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<p><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6959344114005358" data-ad-slot="4928663865"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>

<p>Covariance means that the type being used can be a sub type of the class provided by the super class function return type. Similarly, this works in the same way as the 5th rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apply at the least the same rules to all output parameters as applied by the parent class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now both of these rules aren’t possible to be broken as part of Swift. It’s not possible to overload functions providing alternative type specifications, at least while still referring to the super class type. We can override methods and provide different parameter types and return types but this requires the calling class to know the type of the subclass. When referring to the super class, the super class implementation is always called regardless of subclass functions with different params.</p>

        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In this series of posts we are going to be covering the SOLID principles of software development. These are a set of principles / guidelines, that when followed when developing a software system, make it more likely that the system will be easier to extend and maintain over time. Let’s take a look at the problems that they seek to solve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fragility: A change may break unexpected parts, it is very difficult to detect if you don’t have a good test coverage</li>
  <li>Immobility: A component is difficult to reuse in another project or in multiple places of the same project because it has too many coupled dependencies</li>
  <li>Rigidity: A change requires a lot of effort because it affects several parts of the project</li>
</ul>

<p>So what are the SOLID principles?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Single Responsibility Principle - A class should have only a single responsibility / have only one reason to change</li>
  <li>Open-Closed Principle - Software should be open for extension but closed for modification</li>
  <li>Liskov Substitution Principle - Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their sub types without altering the correctness of the program</li>
  <li>Interface Segregation Principle - Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface</li>
  <li>Dependency Inversion Principle - High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions</li>
</ul>

<p>In this article we will focus on the Open-Closed Principle.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-mean">What does it mean?</h2>

<p>So the open-closed principle states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Software should be open for extension but closed for modification</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly does this mean? I think out of all the principles this is the hardest to understand. Mostly due to the fact the explanation leaves far too much open to interpretation. A simple Google search will offer up several examples of how this principle works. In this article I will present my take on the principle and how to build software that will comply with it.</p>

<p>Let’s focus on a type that by design, violates the open closed principle.</p>

<h2 id="enums">Enums</h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Enumerations.html">Enums</a> are a very powerful tool in Swift. They are first class types and such can have associated values and conform to protocols for example. However when used at the boundary of a particular system or module they can present a particular problem.</p>

<p>Let’s imagine an analytics system where we can log events. This is a design pattern I’ve seen in many places:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="c1">// 1</span>

<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// 3</span>
<span class="kd">extension</span> <span class="kt">AnalyticsEvent</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">title</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">String</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">switch</span> <span class="k">self</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">params</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="kt">String</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">String</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">switch</span> <span class="k">self</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">case</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">newsList</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[:]</span>
        <span class="k">case</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">newsDetail</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">id</span><span class="p">):</span>

        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s look at what we have here.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first thing that is defined is an enum that houses all the different analytics events that are available. Some with associated values.</li>
  <li>Next we have our analytics controller, this takes an event as a parameter, takes information from the event and would then send that on to our analytics system.</li>
  <li>Here we have extended the AnalyticsEvent enum to add 2 variables, one for title and one for params that contain a switch for each of our events.</li>
</ol>

<p>On the surface or at first look this might appear an ok solution. We have hidden our implementation of the analytics network inside our AnalyticsController and setup a defined set of events that we can support.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>

<p>Now lets look at the problems that this approach causes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What happens if we need to add new events to our analytics system?</li>
  <li>What if our analytics system was part of a separate package or module?</li>
  <li>What happens when we have a lot of events?</li>
</ul>

<p>So first of all, every time we need to add / update or remove any of the events in our analytics system we need to modify the enum. We can’t just implement new events and have them be compatible with the system. Also if the number of events becomes very large then the code will grow large in size. Making it hard to read, maintain and a bit of a mess. Also the enum now has multiple responsibilities, as it covers many events breaking the <a href="/architecture/solid-principles-in-swift-single-responsibility-principle.html">single responsibility principle</a>.</p>

<p>The second issue which is probably the more important one, is let’s say we are breaking our app down in to separate packages. This Analytics Controller and Event would be in a separate package, what if we wanted to re-use it across different projects? Both of these scenarios become very difficult because we are using an enum that would need to be updated to accommodate events for different apps. The package would need constantly updating as new events were added.</p>

<h3 id="the-solution">The Solution</h3>

<p>So we have identified some issues with the above implementation, how can we change it to make solve these issues we have identified? Look at the new example:</p>

<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s look at how we have changed the example:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First of all we have now removed the enum. Using an enum as a huge list of possible options is considered a code smell. Especially when it involves something that may change often. If you have a finite number of states that is unlikely to change, that is more suited to an enum than a list of analytics events. We have refactored those enum cases into 2 separate classes now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have switched the enum for a protocol that exposes the necessary items required by our analytics controller (we could have potentially done this in the previous example however we would still have the enum).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So what advantages does this have over the previous implementation?</p>

<ul>
  <li>With the events now being in separate classes we are now following the <a href="/architecture/solid-principles-in-swift-single-responsibility-principle.html">single responsibility principle</a>, each event has its own class that can be updated whenever they need to be.</li>
  <li>Now that we are using a protocol and not an enum, we are now able to add new events to our app without ever having to touch the analytics system. Simply create a new class and make it conform to AnalyticsEvent, and we can use it with the analytics controller.</li>
  <li>Further to that we could have our analytics system in a separate reusable package, then our client apps could define their own set of events to use with the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our analytics code is now open for extension, but does not need to be modified to support new events. Unlike our enum example.</p>
